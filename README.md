## This is my _first_ markdown file!

### A nice picture of Mt. Rainier (or Mt. Tahoma)...
![A nice mountain!](https://github.com/grawfin/Week_one_assignment/blob/master/seattle.jpg)

### Here are some links to some of my current projects...

* [A data explorer for the FGCZ Sequencing team](http://ngskpi.bfabric.org/apps/HTSequencing)
* [A protocol for using illumina tech to test for polyA viruses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130484v1)

#### A Quick Question:

> Would formalizing the results and/or extending the capacity of the protocol linked above,  
be a good project for the project portion of this class? There is certainly plenty of work  
that could be done to both improve, optimize and validate the performance of it.

Let me know [here](griffin.white@uzh.ch) if you'd like! Thank you!
